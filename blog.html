	  <b><p>Sans-serif or Serif? The Great Debate 8/05/24</p></b>
	  <p>Since the dawn of typography, there has been a great debate on whether sans-serif or serif fonts were the superior classification of typeface. Sometime in the 2010's, I was strictly sans-serif. Font's should be minimal, I said, they should be unintrusive. I then came across consolas. I was there, typing in notepad for a magazine I was working at (Yes, I was typing in MS Notepad, and no, I will not elaborate as to why) and when I tabbed back to MS Word, I realised that that the default serif font that MS Notepad uses was so hyper-readible, and compared to MS Word's default font -Calibri- I realised it wasn't even close. Since then I have swapped over the serif fort. Readibility was my main concern with fonts, and serif made me realise I was wrong all along. What do you think? Email me or shoot me a fax!
